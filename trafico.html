                    <p>This rivalry has only existed for a couple of years, but it has been an intense rivalry. When these teams face off against each other, they are not only playing to win, they are also playing for bragging rights. The right to call themselves the best soccer team in Los Angeles.</p>
                    <p>In coopertation with the LA Galaxy, whichever team wins the regular season series will win the, El Tráfico Trophy. If both teams split the season series, there will be a five kick shootout to determine the El Tráfico Trophy champion. This shootout will not count against either teams wins and loss record, it is only played to determine the best LA soccer team.</p>
